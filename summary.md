# EKS MCP Server Integration Summary

## Current Status

We've made significant progress in integrating the EKS MCP Server with the EKS cluster, but we're still facing some authentication challenges. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished and what still needs to be addressed:

### What We've Accomplished

1. **IAM Role Configuration**:
   - Updated the IAM policy for the EKS MCP Server role to include necessary EKS permissions
   - Added specific permissions for the sample-eks-cluster

2. **EKS Cluster Configuration**:
   - Updated the aws-auth ConfigMap to include the EKS MCP Server role
   - Granted the role system:masters permissions in the cluster

3. **Server Implementation**:
   - Implemented the KubernetesOperations class to interact with the EKS cluster
   - Added support for all required Kubernetes operations
   - Added a debug endpoint to help troubleshoot issues

4. **Deployment**:
   - Successfully deployed the updated server to ECS
   - Verified that the server is running and accessible

### Current Issues

1. **Authentication Issues**:
   - The server can successfully authenticate with AWS and get EKS tokens
   - However, kubectl is trying to connect to localhost:8080 instead of the EKS API server
   - This suggests that the kubeconfig is not being properly configured or used

2. **Debugging Results**:
   - AWS credentials are working correctly (verified with `aws sts get-caller-identity`)
   - EKS API access is working correctly (verified with `aws eks list-clusters` and `aws eks describe-cluster`)
   - EKS token generation is working correctly (verified with `aws eks get-token`)
   - kubectl is not configured with any contexts (verified with `kubectl config get-contexts`)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix kubeconfig Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the kubeconfig file is properly created with the correct cluster endpoint
   - Verify that kubectl is using the correct kubeconfig file

2. **Update KubernetesOperations Class**:
   - Modify the `create_kubeconfig` method to explicitly set the server endpoint
   - Ensure that the kubeconfig file is properly formatted and saved

3. **Test with Direct kubectl Commands**:
   - Create a test script that generates a kubeconfig file and runs kubectl commands
   - Verify that the commands work with the generated kubeconfig

4. **Consider Alternative Approaches**:
   - If direct kubectl integration continues to be problematic, consider using the AWS SDK for Kubernetes operations
   - This would involve using the AWS SDK to make direct calls to the Kubernetes API server

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress in integrating the EKS MCP Server with the EKS cluster, but we still need to resolve the authentication issues. The server is successfully authenticating with AWS and can access EKS, but kubectl is not properly configured to use the EKS API server. Once this issue is resolved, the server should be able to interact with the EKS cluster and provide the required functionality.
